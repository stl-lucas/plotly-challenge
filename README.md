<h1>Plotly Challenge</h1>
<h3>Author: Tim Lucas</h3>
<h6>WUSTL Data Analytics Bootcamp homework Week 15</h6>

<p>In this assignment we were tasked with building a webpage that can dynamically build and filter a dropdown menu, demographic information (dictionary), and 3 plots. The web page does not refresh with each change of the dropdown menu but the data and plots change in real-time. The primary style of the HTML page and the data were both provided. The challenge was to write the JavaScript code and use Plotly to create the visuals.</p>

<h6>Step 1</h6>
<p>Use the D3 library to read in the provided data set stored in a json file. Then create a horizontal bar chart using plotly.</p>

<p>Next create the bubble chart, display the sample metadata information stored as key-value pairs in a dictionary and populate the dropdown menu with full list of ids.</p>

<p>Last, change the plots and metadata dynamically when new id is selected.</p>

<h6>Bonus</h6>
<p>Adapt a guage chart from the plotly documentation and modity the value ranges to fit our dataset.</p>
